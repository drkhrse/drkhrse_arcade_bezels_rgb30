# drkhrse 1:1 Arcade Bezels
My 1:1 aspect ratio 720p vertical arcade bezels for Retroarch. There are bezels with included scanlines and ones without to use with your own filters/shaders.

Originally created for the Powkiddy RGB30.

Open game and then go to the [Quick Menu](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/wiki/Global-Shortcuts) for Retroarch (Select + X buttons) > On-Screen Overlay > Overlay Preset > Choose cfg file. Save the override on a per game basis. For more info on setting up the RGB30, I highly recommend the [Retro Game Corps Starter Guide](https://retrogamecorps.com/2023/10/27/powkiddy-rgb30-starter-guide/#Bezels).
