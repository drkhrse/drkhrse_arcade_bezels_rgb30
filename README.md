# drkhrse 1:1 Arcade Bezels
My 1:1 aspect ratio 720p vertical arcade bezels for Retroarch. There will be bezels for specific games based upon cabinet artwork along with default vertical CRT overlays for games without specific bezels. Currently a WIP with more bezels for specific games still coming.

Originally created for the Powkiddy RGB30.

Open game and then go to the [Quick Menu](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/wiki/Global-Shortcuts) for Retroarch (Select + X buttons) > On-Screen Overlay > Overlay Preset > Choose cfg file. Save the override on a per game basis.
